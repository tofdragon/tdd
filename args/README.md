Args

Problem Description:

1.The arguments passed to the program consist of flags and values

2.Flags:

Flags should be one character, preceded by a minus sign   

Each flag should have zero, or one value associated with it

如：

-d 2

-l 

3.You should write a parser for this kind of arguments

The schema specifies the number and types of flags and values the program expects.

[参数期望的标记,标记的类型,标记的值]

4.The program can then ask the args parser for each of the values, using the names of the flags

The values are returned with the correct types, as specified in the schema.

5.The program can then ask the args parser for each of the values, 

using the names of the flags. The values are returned with the correct types, as specified in the schema
